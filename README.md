## Project Information
- **Project Title**: `ANALYSIS AND MODEL DEVELOPMENT FOR WEATHER FORECASTING IN DISTRICTS OF HO CHI MINH CITY`
- **Dataset**: `HCMCityWeather.csv` (last updated: 26/10/2024)

## Overview dataset
- Collected from the [Open-Meteo Historical Weather API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api), based on the coordinate data of 22 districts, towns, and cities in Ho Chi Minh City, gathered from the [Nominatim | OpenStreetMap Website](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html).
- Size: `80.388 rows x 29 columns`
- The attributes include recorded weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind direction, rainfall, cloud cover, and more.

## Summary
- **Objective**: To analyze and develop models for weather forecasting in districts of Ho Chi Minh City.
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Tasks**:
  - Data preprocessing: Clean, transform, and visualize the dataset.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to gain insights into the weather patterns.
  - Model development: Develop a model to predict the probability of rain for the next day in the districts of Ho Chi Minh City. (Classification problem)
  - Model evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
  - Model deployment: Deploy the model as a web application for users to access and interact with.

## Technology: 
- **ipynb**: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Xgboost, Lightgbm
- **Website**: Streamlit
